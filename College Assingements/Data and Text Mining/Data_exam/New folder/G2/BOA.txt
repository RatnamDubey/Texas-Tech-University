At Bank of America, our purpose is simple and clear. We are here to make financial lives better. Better by
connecting our customers and clients to the financial solutions they need. Better by connecting across our
company to deliver those solutions. And, better by making connections in the communities in which we live and
work.
Over the past several years, we have transformed the company to better position us to deliver on our purpose.
We have strengthened our foundation, building capital to industry-leading levels. We have addressed many of
the legacy issues that arose from the economic downturn. And, we have streamlined our business to focus only
on what is most important to our customers and clients. All of this has made us an easier company to do
business with for our customers and clients, and a better place to work for our employees.
Being a responsible company is integral to our success and we are engaged on the issues that matter most to
our customers, employees and communities. Our employees around the world are guided by a common set of
values that ensure we deliver on our company goals while also helping to address both local and global
challenges. Iâ€™m proud of the impact we make each day through volunteering and philanthropy, the revitalization
of our neighborhoods, and our involvement in so many important issues, including hunger relief, education, job
training, the environment and support for our military and veterans.
With the talent and capabilities we have in place, we can do more than any other company to help our
customers and clients realize their financial goals. And with our purpose so clearly defined, there is every
reason to be optimistic and excited about what lies ahead for our company. For more information, I invite you to
review this report.
Thank you for your continued interest in Bank of America.
