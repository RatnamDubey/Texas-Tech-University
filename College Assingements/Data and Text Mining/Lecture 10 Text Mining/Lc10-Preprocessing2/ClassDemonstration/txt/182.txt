 It successfully charged me $14.99 for subscription. It doesn't let me watch anything by asking me to renew subscription. In billing, it says I am not subscribed. I try to play a video and when renew subscription dialog pops up, I pressed the Renew Button. It gets stuck at Validating Account. Their phone support is not available 24x7 and gives a busy signal instead of telling us about their work time or that it is closed currently. I used email support and got someone to respond within a couple of hours. I sent them the necessary information - an attachment of the subscription confirmation from play store. After that, no response at all. Today I called phone support. I have been on the wait queue for 20 minutes. I think I just lost my 15 bucks and ruined my Sunday night and wasted my time dealing with their incompetence. It would have been nice if they at least acknowledged the issue and sent out an email with an ETA of the fix to everyone (looking at reviews, I am not the only one facing this issue) affected by the issue and maybe a free month or 2 to compensate for the loss of time and happiness.
