 UPDATE:  Their support team sent me the "secret handshake" that you have to know to get your registered account linked to the app in involving logging in and out, registering but not, etc.  The app now works (good).  I'd give it 4 stars but for the terrible registration process.   Original review:  Does NOT let you set up an account.  I tried to download and create an account but there was an error when creating, now it takes my credentials that I set up but it keeps taking me back to the subscribe with the "restart NOW" .
