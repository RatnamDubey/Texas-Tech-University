Wont let me in Started up on my smart tv. And I just downloaded it on my phone. A galaxy 5 with marshmallow 6.0. The app keeps saying i have the wrong password. And it will not send an email that allows me to change the password... i just want to see game of thrones! People pay for this! Get it together hbo. Looks like it isnt working for a lot of people....
