Did they even test this app Stuck in a loop. It continually asks me to renew my subscription when logging in, even though Google shows me as active. I don't see how this app could have been tested before release as it seems EVERYONE is having this same issue. It makes it appear as if HBO just doesn't care. Fine with me. I'll take my money elsewhere.
