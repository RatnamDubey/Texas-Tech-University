Endlessly asks to renew Any time I press play on something a splash screen shows up that says "renew" on it, if you hit that button it just takes you back to the log in screen.  Hit the tiny X in the top right corner instead and it goes back home.  Cannot play anything!  So annoying.  Same thing on Android TV also.  Going to try laptop...
