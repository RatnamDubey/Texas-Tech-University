 It's a good app to watch all your favorite  HBO shows, but it's severely lacking in many aspects.  I still can't for the life of me figure out how to put a series in my watchlist, and with no quick access to play the next episode of the current series you're watching, I need to constantly search for Game of Thrones and then scroll down to find the episode I'm on.  It gets tedious.  But generally the quality is fine and Chromecast support is solid.  With a few updates it could be much better.
