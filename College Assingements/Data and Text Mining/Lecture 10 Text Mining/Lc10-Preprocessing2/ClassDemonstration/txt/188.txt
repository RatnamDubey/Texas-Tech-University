TERRIBLE Im having the same issue as everyone else, paid for the app and keep getting the same billing/set up new account loop. I emailed their customer support and they had the nerve to ask me to describe the issue in more detail as though im the only one having the issue. ****UPDATE**** After posting my negative feedback, the Google team came through and provided me with a solution and im now able to watch the app.
