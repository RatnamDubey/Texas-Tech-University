It has to work to be considered useful Stuck in login loop everyone else is complaining about.. I'd love to pay for the one show I want to watch and I'm burning up free trial time, but if things are obfuscated with accounts and crap service then it's only frustrating and I'll cancel it anyways. Wish I could ask for my time and data back from installing this app..
