Won't sign in Signed up for a free trial, entered payment info, then I signed it. It asked me to renew my subscription? Then when I clicked to renew my "subscription" that's supposed to be a trial month.. It says that it's validating my account, then asks me to sign in again! I've gone through it 6 times now and it still won't work?!
