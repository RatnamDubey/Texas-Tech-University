 Started free trial, subscription is there in my account. HBO Now says no subscription. Cancel that one. Try clicking on renew subscription. That just logs out and takes me to the login screen. Utterly disappointed, re-registered with other email, now it seems to be working but the video doesn't play on the computer, or, anywhere. The service seems to be way too glitchy for 15 bucks a month...
