Big fail! Im subscribed on google play but it's not being recognized by the app! Thanks Joseph DeStefanis for the work around! Update: To fix: Sign in. You'll get the renew screen. Close it and go to settings. Sign out. Click I don't have an account. Don't enter info, scroll to the bottom. Click I have an account and log in again.
