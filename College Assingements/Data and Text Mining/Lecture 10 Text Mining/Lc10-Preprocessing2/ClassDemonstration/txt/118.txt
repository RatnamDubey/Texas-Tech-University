It's just "meh" I love having access to hbo without cable. I can finally pay for the content i want instead of stealing it!  However, the service isn't "mature" yet. My issues are with the service in general, target than the app itself.  Freezes somewhat often (even on desktop in a browser, so it's not specific to the app). Also, why can't we add entire shows/seasons to our watchlist? I hate having to search or browse to pick back up where I left off...
