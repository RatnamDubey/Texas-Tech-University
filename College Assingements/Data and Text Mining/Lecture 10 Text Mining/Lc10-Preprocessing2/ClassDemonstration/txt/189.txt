Crap quality Unlike a lot of other people rating the app, my subscription went through no problem. But the video quality is garbage! It's like watching in 480p. I know it's not my Internet speed because I can go to another streaming service and it's crystal clear. Fix this HBO! You cost more than Netflix and provide crap.
