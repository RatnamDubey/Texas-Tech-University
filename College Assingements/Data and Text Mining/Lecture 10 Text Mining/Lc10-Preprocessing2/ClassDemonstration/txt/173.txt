Root/Chromecast This is beyond frustrating. I WANT to pay for my HBO content. First you gate Now for a timed exclusive on ios, that's fine, I'm a gamer so I'm used to it. Then when you release Now to the android verse you don't support Chromecast? Go has it, why doesn't Now?! However, that doesn't even matter because I ROOT all my android devices, making the Now app completely useless. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE PIRATE. Why is paying for the content so freaking difficult!?       July is over, still no Chromecast support.
