Subscription issue I attempted to subscribe but my attempts to watch anything was not working.  I signed out of google play to see if that worked which was a no go.  My subscription under Google play has me subscribed with a due date for the first withdrawl,hbo does not.  Update thanks to Joseph D i was able to login.  When the renew screen appear sign out out, click sign in but don't input info, click already have account, sign in should fix problem.
