Thank you HBO I had a problem with my subscription and HBO sent the solution to my email without my having asked. The app works fine now. For people comparing this app to Netflix, be real. Netflix has no where near the quality programming and movies that HBO shows/produces. Their documentaries alone are worth the subscription.
