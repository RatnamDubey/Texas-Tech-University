 This is literally the worst app I have ever experienced in my 26 year old life. I created an account, subscribed for the next moth with a credit card but when I log in it tells me to renew my subscription. No matter what I do I can't get it to work. HBO this is literally why everybody pirates your show. I have canceled my subscription to HBO now which I have willingly paid money for. You will no longer get a dime from me. I am admitting to pirating your show since I have tried throwing money at you for the past 45 minutes but can't watch a single second.
