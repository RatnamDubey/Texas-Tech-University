 Doesn't work on my Google TV device.  Can't cast it to my TV.  Why would I want to watch on a little screen?  Love the content.  Just not fully developed.  How about a XBox app?  Now we have an X-Box app.  Thank you and the service would work great if Google Play could take a proper payment and get the service running.  They seem to think a payment is a refund.  I'm sure they will figure it out over time but my money is not waiting.  I'll support another business, like Apple.
