 Though the update notes for the version I installed specifically say that they fixed "issue preventing some new subscribers from streaming due to persistent renewal prompts", that's exactly the behavior I see. I gave them credit card info, I received an email receipt confirming $0 for the first free month, but so far I cannot stream anything. As soon as I try, I'm prompted to "renew" which leads me through the whole login process again. Seriously, total fail.
