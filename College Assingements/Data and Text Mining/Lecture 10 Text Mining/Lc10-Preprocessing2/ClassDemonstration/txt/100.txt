Can't subscribe or get trial Made a new account, errored out the first time I tried entering subscription info yesterday. Tried again today, got a Google confirmation I'm suscribed, but the app says I'm not. I'd even sign up to pay for the service and completely forgo the free trial but the app just isn't working.
