Just wanna watch Game of Thrones I have spent the last hour or so uninstalling and reinstalling the app trying to get rid of the screen telling me to renew my subscription. Even when I try to renew it says I'm already subscribed and doesn't allow me to move forward. So even tho I'm willing to pay for a subscription that's supposed to be a free trial it won't work. I'm giving up. Maybe I'll fight with it some more tomorrow.
