What the hell?!? I was all excited about having hbo available on my phone, but it keeps telling me to either renew my subscription or link my new  subscription.  Then it takes me back to the log in screen or choose whether I use optima or verizon... Are those the only options? Anyway, I'm canceling my subscription until you solve this. Get your stuff together HBO, this really is unfortunate.
