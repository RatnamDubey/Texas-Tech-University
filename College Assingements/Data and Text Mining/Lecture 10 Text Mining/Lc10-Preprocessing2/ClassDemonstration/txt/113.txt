Hit the back key at the home screen So, I figured it out and I want to share my find. My biggest issue with this app is the navigation. To actually have to go back into the app, scroll through every episode to find where you were is annoying. I've discovered that when ever you are on the home page and you hit back it takes you back to where you were :) . You're  welcome.
