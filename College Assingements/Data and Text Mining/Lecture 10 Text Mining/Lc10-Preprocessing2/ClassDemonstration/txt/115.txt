 Works alright with chromecast. Major usability issues with playback on my phone (2014 Moto X) and tablet (Galaxy Note 8).  My tablet is a bit old. But, my phone is not. The picture will constantly freeze while the sound keeps going. That's when it's not stuttering from the service not being able to stream fast enough, which you will also see when streaming to your chromecast.   On top of THAT, if you're watching a series, there's no option to select the next one and watch it. You have to go all the way back through the navigation system to find the next episode. That's a pretty basic feature that should have been included at launch. Don't even think about being able to skip to a point in time, forward or back, without some issues.
