 Utter garbage.  Took me 20 minutes to set up a free trial account and then it wouldn't let me log in.  It seriously wanted me to have a subscription with a television service for the honor of paying another $15 a month for shows I'd already have if I had a television provider.   I just wanted to watch Game of Thrones, man.  It would have been worth it for that - but I couldn't.
