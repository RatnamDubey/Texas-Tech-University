 It won't allow me to play anything. It asks me to renew my subscription even though I just create it. I try to renew anyways and it keeps going on an endless loop of it asking me to login and going back to asking me to renew. No matter what i try I can't get it to work. Seems like it is having an issue validating the account for some reason even though google play store sent me a conformation email saying my payment went through. Been at this for about an hour trying to get this to work. From the other reviews it seems like many people are having the same issue. Looks like I'm going to have to wait a while to watch Game of thrones :(
