 I find it really irritating that subscription can't be done on the computer via the website. I had to jump through hoops to figure out exactly how to subscribe and use this on my computer. When I finally did subscribe (with my receipt in my email) I got on with both my phone and my computer just to find that I need to "resubscribe in order to have unlimited access". Since I have to use my phone to process any kind of "re-subscription" I got on and now all it's doing is sending me to login, then to resubscribe, 'validating account...', then back to log in. This is extremely frustrating.
