 I can't believe hbo could put out an app that is this messed up.  signed up for a free trial so I could watch GOT tonight and I get caught in an endless loop of registration errors.  Can't watch a single thing.  I would be willing to pay and skip the free trial if that meant I could have access to the content but it is unusable.  I've been on hold with customer service for about half an hour.  Just a HORRIBLE service.  Figure it out HBO, seriously.  In the meantime I guess I'll just torrent it like every other person on the planet.
