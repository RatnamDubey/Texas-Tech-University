 Without exaggerating but probably the worst piece of software I've seen since 1995 written by someone who's not a teenager over a weekend.   Throws a generic playback error every 2 minutes. Sometimes starts playing 2 tracks of the audio at time 0:00 when the video is at 30:00. UI will not respond to clicks on the main menu, or the overlay will not respond to clicks on the video. As embarrassingly bad as software could be.
