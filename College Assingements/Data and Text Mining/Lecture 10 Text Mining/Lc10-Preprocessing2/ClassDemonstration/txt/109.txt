Subscription doesn't work Subscription isn't linking. Just keeps telling me to renew but I bought it yesterday. Last annoying part in an overly complicated process to watch your shows. You know what I did when I wanted Netflix? I went on the website and signed up. Why does this have to be so difficult?
