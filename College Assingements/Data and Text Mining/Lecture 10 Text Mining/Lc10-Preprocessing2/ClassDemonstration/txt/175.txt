Horrible customer service and app usability Signed up for a "free" 30 day trial and it not only immediately charged me the $14.99(false advertising), but is now stuck in a loop where it is asking for me to renew my subscribtion. It will not allow me to view anything. So much for my GoT party I hosted... Every time I try to call their customer support I get a busy dial tone. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. I want my $14.99 back, ya crooks.
