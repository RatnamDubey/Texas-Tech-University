For those with issues.... I have no idea what issues you are having about freezing or what, but i installed and was instantly watching GoT. I've had no issues watching anything, neither has my wife. We just have T-Mobile data and no home Internet and haven't had a problem yet. I'll gladly pay the $15/month for HBO programming
