 Amazing how a major company like HBO makes such a deficient product like HBO Now. Amazing how we are TRYING to give them business by using this product but they make it soooo complicated... I waited over 30 minutes on the phone just to see how to make this work for me.... I am willing to PAY these guys, I WANT to be a customer, and yet, they give you their costumer service is so poor like they just DO NOT CARE.  Amazing amazing.... Forget it... Easier to just find the pirated versions on line.
