Irritating Love the shows, and movies. Love having them on an app, but the app doesnt work well. Shows randomly start fast forwarding with chipmunk voices, and it doesnt keep the same frame. The last scene and the scene im currently watching mix together. The app is bad. Fix those issues, and it will be great. I have having to close the app 20 times for a 50 minute show. Im only on the free trial, i can tell you now i will cancel the subscription after the free trial due to these errors.
