 I have noticed that a lot of people have has issues with HBO Now, regarding logging in and being asked to resubscribe. I as well had this issue. I called customer service, only had to wait about 15 minutes before speaking to a customer service agent. They stayed on the phone with me, providing step by step instructions and had the issue resolved in just a few minutes. I understand when things aren't working perfectly, its frustrating, but they  are providing excellent customer service and resolving the issue.  If your having this issue i definitely encourage you to call, they will fix the problem in no time. :)
