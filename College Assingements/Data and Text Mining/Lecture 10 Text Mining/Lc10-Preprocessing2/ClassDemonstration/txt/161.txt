Infinity loop of renew subscription bug I originally subscribed through iTunes then cancelled it a year ago. Now, I want to renew my subscription through Google play. It doesn't work even though Google play shows I subscribe HBO now. It keeps telling me to renew my subscription not allowing me watching any content. I can't permanently delete my subscription from iTunes if I want to subscribe through Google play. Fix the problem HBO!
