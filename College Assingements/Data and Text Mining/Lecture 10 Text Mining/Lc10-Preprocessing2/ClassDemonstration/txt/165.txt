Subscription doesn't work if email doesn't match Google account. Google says that I am subscribed with the free trial.  However, when I try to log in, HBO says that I don't have a subscription and that I need to renew it.  Even if I try to "renew", the system just kicks me out.  Not cool.    ----- I figured it out.  Apparently, I registered with a Hotmail email rather than my Google account.  So, I simply made a new HBO Now account with my Gmail and HBO detected the subscription automatically without asking for another trial.
