Unintuitive/circular Advertised as 'new stand alone streaming service' great except it's not stand alone and it makes actually streaming really hard. One has to subscribe through, not hbo. Once one gets subscribed the app prevents streaming by constantly promoting for renewal even if one is subscribed. Terribly frustrating. Unhelpfully circular. Unintuitive. Added middle man. Poorly executed.
