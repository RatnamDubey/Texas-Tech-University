 Subscription renewal would not initially let me log in & watch anything on my phone or xbox. kept looping for renewal. i read a review just now, i followed his steps & it worked now on my phone. i hope my xbox works now when i get home. we'll see. otherwise i'm not sure what happened & it was a bummer to miss the premier of GOT. But i'm happy it's working now.     review from another user (Joseph DeStefanis) copied & pasted. IT WORKED. if i didn't need to go through all this, i'd give it 5 stars.  "Update: To fix: Sign in. You'll get the renew screen. Close it and go to settings. Sign out. Click I don't have an account. Don't enter info, scroll to the bottom. Click I have an account and log in again. Why this dance? Who knows, but it works."
