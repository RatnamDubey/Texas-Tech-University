Terrible! !! Freezes, speeding up, voices go high then low in spead. Movies skip half of it while playing. Takes 3 hours to watch a movie. Constantly logging in then logging out. Has stopped working 6 times since I've had it installed for a week. 30 day free trial only had g or 2 weeks ended up uninstalling. Thought I would try it again installed now they want me to pay. Come on I only had a free trial for 2 weeks because of the issues with the app. Should be free for another 30 days trial.
