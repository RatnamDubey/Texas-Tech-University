Doesn't work! I wish I could give this piece of garbage less than one star. First of all, it says in the app description "fixed a bug preventing  new subscribers from using app due to constant renewal popups" or somthing to that effect. Guess what, they didn't fix it. Keep getting those retarded popups and now we get to miss the Game of Thrones premier. Doesn't matter that the play store says I have an active subscription, bottom line is this app is a piece of trash. Bugged out and completely useless, don't download.
