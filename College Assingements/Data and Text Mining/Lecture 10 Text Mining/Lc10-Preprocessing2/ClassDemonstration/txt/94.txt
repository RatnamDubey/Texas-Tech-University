HOW TO FIX RENEW LOOP! Props to Joseph! Getting the irritating renew loop try this! Props to Joseph! 1. sign in(you'll get the renew screen, exit out that screen) 2. Go to settings, sign out. 3. Go to bottom of the screen where it says "I dont have an account" click/tap there. 4. Dont enter any information and go to the bottom where it says sign in. 5. Sign into your account. Then click on a movie/episode and it works. IRRITATING HASTLE BUT IT DOES WORK. Your welcome! Thanks again Joseph.
