Great idea. Poor execution. The video player needs a complete overhaul to justify even a fraction of the cost. I understand that in high airtime traffic times, connections get strained. This is especially true in areas with older cell towers. Netflix and Hulu have taken this into account and, even if it takes a long time to load, they will play and play well. I can't help but feel that HBO didn't take the  time to develop a proper app that can handle this. Instead the player will act like an old VHS and fast forward through everything
