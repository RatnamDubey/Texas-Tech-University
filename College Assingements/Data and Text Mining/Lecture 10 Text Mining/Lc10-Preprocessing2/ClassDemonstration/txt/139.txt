Missing some features App works great and decent design, but the ability to follow shows is really needed. And a section showing "continue watching" for shows you're currently watching. Watchlist is just individual episodes so it's hard to keep track of the shows you actually care about. If you could follow shows and it would list their most recent episodes into one feed that would be perfect. Basically it just mixes old and new content into one messy bundle with no care for user preference or interest.
