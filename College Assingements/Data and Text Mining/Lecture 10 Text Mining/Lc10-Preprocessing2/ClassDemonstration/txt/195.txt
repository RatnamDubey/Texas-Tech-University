Not To Shabby Nice to have HBO available without a traditional cable subscription. Great content and very accessible, though lacking in features and usability when compared to other streaming services. Limited device support is a drawback as well, however it works  great with new chromecast. (5 stars if recently watched categories and auto-play functionality are added!)
