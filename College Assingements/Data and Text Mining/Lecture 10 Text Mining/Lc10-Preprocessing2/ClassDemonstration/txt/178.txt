Glitchy Dissapointed. It can have it's good moments, but it will randomly freeze and all I can hear is the voices in the show I'm watching talk in fast forward. Like the high pitched helium voices. Or it will do the same thing and talk in slow motion. So weird. So frustrating. But the worse is when it freezes and doesn't do anything but the time keeps ticking so when it finally unfreezes the show is like 2 minutes ahead of where it froze. I want to be able to use it. But I spend more time being frustated at it.
