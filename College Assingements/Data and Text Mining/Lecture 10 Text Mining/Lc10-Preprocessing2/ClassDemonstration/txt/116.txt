Good app, poor execution Took me 1 hour to figure out how to get this app to play on my LG TV through a completely bulls hit round about way. Then another hour trying to find out how to pay for it. And then, it used the email I don't use for products and I had no way to change it. I really wanted to give you guys at HBO my money, I just can't if your product is this hard to get working. It's easier to just download or stream off of whatever website. Thanks HBO for forcing my hand into not paying you guys.
