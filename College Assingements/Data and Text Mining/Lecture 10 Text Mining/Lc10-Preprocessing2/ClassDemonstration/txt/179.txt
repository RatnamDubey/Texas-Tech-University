Poor experience compared with other services Blurry low quality video with muddy sound that lags skips and freezes while Amazon prime and Netflix deliver consistently clear and hassle free video. Frequent errors saying that I'm outside the US when I'm not. Higher price tag than either other service. Good thing there is a free trial so you can see how terrible it is.
