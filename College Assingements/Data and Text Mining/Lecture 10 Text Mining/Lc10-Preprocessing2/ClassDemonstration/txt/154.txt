It's not the app itself... Well it kinda is. I tried to subscribe for the first time, I went through the motions with Google and subscribed, and this app would not accept my subscription. Google says I'm good, and I'm still good till next month but this app keeps asking me to renew my subscription. Nice FAIL on opening of GOT night. I tried to do the same online and that is also a NOPE! Don't bother until they fix! 4/24/16 10:32pm EST.
